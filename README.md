# wk-2-code
The first assignment requires the first letter to be in lower case and the remaining letters to be in upper case.
    the code assigns the first letter to be in lowercase  and we use the function slice to make the rest upper case.

The second assignment is the generate array and accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. 
     it generates all the values between the first and last numbers

The third assignment writes  a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.
